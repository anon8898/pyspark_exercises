# Purpose

This repo houses a sample of different pyspark exercises. The questions are not intended to be large, complex big data solutions, but questions to help practice coding in pyspark.

Each folder is a different set of questions for a given dataset (which will be provided)

The questions are found in the README of each folder, as well as how to import the dataset for the problems.

The solutions provided for each section will only outline one possible way to complete the problems, there will always be another way to solve the problem than the one shown in the solutions script.

contributions are always welcome - enjoy!

*Note*
- most solutions provided are using dataframes, however these exercises can be done using rdd's, and some not using pyspark at all and using pandas/pure python
